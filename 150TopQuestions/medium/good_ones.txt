28_findTheIndexOfTheFirstOccurrenceInAString
This one assumes that you know or are able to invent in 30 minutes the
Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) string search algorithm. I'm not currently taking the
time to learn that, and I'm not sure that it's a good question.

29_divideTwoIntegers
This one is annoying and dumb.

105_constructBinaryTreeFromPreorderAndInorderTraversal
This one is hard. And I don't like it.

134_gasStation
This one is a "greedy" problem that isn't obvious. I don't like it and don't htink it' a good test.

138_copyListWithRandomPointer
This one is just too long/difficult to test for me to try right now. Maybe come back to it!
