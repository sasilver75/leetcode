Copy List with RAndom Pointer

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an
additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep coy should consist of exactly n brand
new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of the corersponding
original node.
Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes
should point to the new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers
of the original list and copied list represent the same list state.

None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the old list.

Return the head of the copied list
